**Contributing to this template**

This template reflects what I learned from reviewing the policies of many open source projects, not my experience as an open source maintainer. If you think something important is missing or should be different based on your experience, I'd love to hear it! (Keep in mind this is meant to be a first pass checklist, not a full-fledged guide in itself.) If you have suggestions for improving this template, open an issue on this project.
